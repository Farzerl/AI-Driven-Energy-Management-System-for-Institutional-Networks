# Cost-Impact Evidence

This folder contains a public-source planning estimate for the AI4I-EMS submission.

## Main results

- Study-period energy: 3,753,338 kWh.
- Indicative eight-month bill: USD 603,536.75.
- Estimated monthly bill range: approximately USD 50,673 to USD 90,921.
- Estimated maximum-demand range: approximately 743 to 1,267 kVA.
- Central planning scenario: approximately USD 14,170 or 2.35% of the indicative baseline.

## Important limitation

These are not actual UZ invoices or realised savings. The public national average tariff and study-level aggregate figures are used because the institutional bill and account tariff are confidential.
